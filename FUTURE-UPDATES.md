## Improvements & New Features

- [ ] The "+ New Ticket" Buttons on the Dashboard and Tickets pages have a slightly different appearance. Make sure they look the exact same.
- [ ] Noththing happens when I click on the "View/Edit" button on tickets. Make sure that functionality is added/working.
- [ ] There should be a way to delete tickets.
- [ ] In the "Quick Stats" box, it has the header "By State" and then it lists the State and the number of tickets in the state, however the number of tickets is super far away from the name of the state. Can you make that spacing more ideal and bring them closer together?
