## Improvements & New Features

- [ ] The Term of Use and Privacy Policy should have a "Back" button, it doesnt have to be that exeact wording. Pick whatever works best
- [ ] When you click on a ticket category ("Expired", "Expiring Soon", "Active", "All" ) it should take you to the ticket page with that catagory selected. Currently it always takes you to the "All" category on the ticket page.
- [ ] When you go the the "Renew" popup, it has text saying "Ticket info ready to paste into 811 portal!" as soon as you open the popup. That text should show up until the info has been copied.
