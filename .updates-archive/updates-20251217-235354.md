# Future Updates for 811 Ticket Tracker

This file tracks requested updates, bug fixes, and improvements for the 811 Ticket Tracker app.

## Bugs to Fix

- [ ] The formating for mobile devices has a couple of issues. I dont want the user to have to scroll horizontally. Currently the header with all the tabs ("Dashboard", "Tickets", "Settings") is too wide to fit on one screen. Also the "811 Ticket Tracker" title gets written on top of the "Dashbord" text in the header. Every field where you have to enter a date in is also too wide. Fix these issues and make sure that the site will dynmicaaly adjust to fit any phone.
- [ ] When you delete a ticket you have to refresh the site to see the changes applied tp the UI. The changes should update on the UI when you confirm the deletion.
