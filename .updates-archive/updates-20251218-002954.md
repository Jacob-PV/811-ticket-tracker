# Future Updates for 811 Ticket Tracker

This file tracks requested updates, bug fixes, and improvements for the 811 Ticket Tracker app.

## Bugs to Fix

- [ ] The "Submit Date", "Expiration Date", and "New Experation Date" field are all to wide when dispalyed on a mobile device. Make sure the user does not have to scroll horizontally and that the width will update dynamically to fit the screen.

## Improvements & New Features

- [ ] I still want the 3 tabs at the top of the screen to have text labels even when they are on mobile for "Dashboard", "Tickets", and "Settings". Make sure they still fit on the screen though and dont cause horizontal scrolling and dont overlap with the "811 Tickets" title. Maybe they could get moved onto a row below the title and log out buttons. The settings cog wheel could possible stay in the top row by the logout button with no text on the small sceen (mobile) version. Do some ux/ui research to see what will work best. I would like to have the tab logo also included with the text if there is enough room for that.
- [ ] Can we add a placeholder settings page for when you click on that tab until we implament it. It could just say something like "will implament soon"
